Simple LOL Account Manager
No netcode, all account info is stored locally in the local folder of the program in a JSON file. Regardless, password is censored in the database field. 
Logs in and out of league, riot client confirmation (opening the game post login) has to be done manually.
Should work for all window sizes.
